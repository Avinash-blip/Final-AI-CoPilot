    "example_answer": "On the Bangalore → Mumbai corridor, Safe and secure logistics pvt ltd is handling the highest number of delayed trips in this sample, well ahead of the next few transporters.

    "example_answer": "Looking at route mix, each large transporter has a few dominant lanes where most of their trips sit. For example, Safe and secure logistics pvt ltd is heavily concentrated on a handful of high-volume routes, while others like BPV RITCO and TEJ Carrier spread their volume across a slightly wider set of lanes. This kind of view helps you decide where to focus lane-level performance reviews with each partner."
